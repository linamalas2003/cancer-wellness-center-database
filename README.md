Developed a comprehensive and normalized database system to manage critical operations for a cancer wellness center, including patient records, medical histories, appointment scheduling, treatment plans, billing, and staff management. The database schema was designed to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy. Role-based access controls were implemented to secure sensitive data, allowing patients and employees to access appropriate information through user-specific portals. Automated SQL reporting features, such as patient summaries, billing updates, and performance statistics, streamlined administrative workflows and enhanced decision-making.
